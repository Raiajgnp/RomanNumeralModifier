# Roman Numeral Modifier

This project implements a **Roman Numeral Modifier** that performs conversions between Roman numerals and integers using three programming languages at different abstraction levels:  

- **High-Level Language:** Python  
- **Mid-Level Language:** C++  
- **Low-Level Language:** Assembly Language  

## Features  
1. **Bidirectional Conversion:**  
   - Integer to Roman numeral  
   - Roman numeral to Integer  

2. **Infinite Conversion Loop:**  
   - Perform continuous conversions until the user chooses to exit.  

3. **Step-by-Step Conversion Explanation:**  
   - Displays the process for converting between integer and Roman numeral.  

4. **Execution Time Comparison:**  
   - Measures and displays the execution time for each language implementation.  


### Prerequisites  
Ensure the required environments are set up for each programming language:  
- **Python:** Python 3.11.5 or later  
- **C++:** Compiler such as `cl.exe` (Visual Studio) or GCC  
- **Assembly:** MASM and Irvine library
